# MineAvoid

Unfortunately most of the class and OOP tutorials in Python are complete garbage and don't really explain that (important) part of coding very well.
So I decided to take the only tutorial and project I actually understood and create my own learning-code for the usage of classes and OOP in Python. 
The project I forked is from http://introtopython.org/classes.html and I extend it with more and more features from time to time.

What the code currently does ist to create a rocket, a battlefield (10 points height and 10 points wide), a station and an explosive mine.
Then it generates a random coordinate (X & Y) for the mine, while the rocket moves randomly through the battlefield until it hits the mine or runs out of gas.
Once it runs out of gas, the rocket returns back to lunar base and gets filled up again with gas - in case it hits the mine, it's destroyed.

It's a nice simple and briefly example of classes and OOP in Python, which gave me the opportunity to finally understand this important topic of coding.
